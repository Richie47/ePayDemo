They didn't have a test environment so I "made" one

You need git, node, express, and jquery to run this.

#Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads ,download git bash as in the installation options

#Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

#Express: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

#JQuery: npm install jquery

Then find a directory/folder you want to put this in and open Git-Bash and go into that directory.

#1) Type git clone " "

#2) Then type `node server.js` and it should print out in the console go to localhost:8080

#3) in a browser of your choice, type localhost:8080 in the search url and you should have my work environment.
